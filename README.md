# AI Reference Architectures
This repository contains the recommended ways to train and deploy machine learning models on Azure. It ranges from running massively parallel [hyperparameter tuning using Hyperdrive](https://github.com/Microsoft/MLHyperparameterTuning) to deploying deep learning models on [Kubernetes](https://github.com/Microsoft/AKSDeploymentTutorialAML). Each [tutorial](#tutorials) takes you step by step through the process to train or deploy your model. If you are confused about what service to use and when look at the [FAQ](#faq) below.  

For further documentation on the reference architectures please look [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/).

# Getting Started
This repository is arranged as submodules and therefore you can either pull all the tutorials or simply the ones you want. 

<p align="center">

To pull all the tutorials simply run:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Microsoft/AIReferenceArchitectures.git
```

if you have git older than 2.13 run:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Microsoft/AIReferenceArchitectures.git
```

# Requirements
The tutorials have been mainly tested on Linux VMs in Azure. Each tutorial may have slightly different requirements such as GPU for some of the deep learning ones. For more details please consult the readme in each tutorial.

## Reporting Issues
Please report issues with each tutorial in the tutorial's own github page.

<summary><em>What service should I use for deploying models in Python? </em></summary>

When deploying ML models in Python there are two core questions. The first is will it be real time and whether the model is a deep learning model. For deploying deep learning models that require real time we recommend Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) with GPUs. For a tutorial on how to do that look at [AKS w/GPU](https://github.com/Microsoft/AKSDeploymentTutorialAML). For deploying deep learning models for batch scoring we recommend using AzureML pipelines with GPUs, for a tutorial on how to do that look [AzureML Pipelines w/GPU](https://github.com/Azure/Batch-Scoring-Deep-Learning-Models-With-AML). For non deep learning models we recommend you use the same services but without GPUs. For a tutorial on deploying classical ML models for real time scoring look [AKS](https://github.com/Microsoft/MLAKSDeployAML) and for batch scoring [AzureML Pipelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/AMLBatchScoringPipeline)

<p align="center">

</p>

There are many options for training ML models in Python on Azure. The most straight forward way is to train your model on a [DSVM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/). You can either do this in local model straight on the VM or through attaching it in AzureML as a compute target. If you want to have AzureML manage the compute for you and scale it up and down based on whether jobs are waiting in the queue then you should AzureML Compute. 

Now if you are going to run multiple jobs for hyperparameter tuning or other purposes then we would recommend using [Hyperdrive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-tune-hyperparameters), [Azure automated ML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-automated-ml) or AzureML Compute dependent on your requirements.
For a tutorial on how to use Hyperdrive go [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/MLHyperparameterTuning).
